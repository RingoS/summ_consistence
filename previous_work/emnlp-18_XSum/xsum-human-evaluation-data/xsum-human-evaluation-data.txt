Glorious sunshine and a pristine pitch made for perfect conditions at the RDS , encouraging both teams to play adventurous , running rugby .
Leinster led after just four minutes as flanker Leavy collected a neat grubber kick from centre Noel Reid to touch down in the corner .
Their lead did not last long as the visitors counter-attacked at pace , with captain Blaine Scully and Rey Lee-Lo offloading sharply before Williams cantered over .
The Blues were threatening whenever their backs got their hands on the ball but their pack struggled against the ballast of Leinster 's forwards , whose powerful carries paved the way for scrum-half McGrath to dive through a crowd of bodies and touch down .
The visitors fought back in spectacular fashion , with Williams finishing after a fine run from hooker Kristian Dacey , before replacement back-rower Bennett showed a similarly impressive turn of pace to run in from 40 yards and put the Blues 21-17 ahead .
It was the Leinster pack , however , who had the final say , with lock Molony emerging at the bottom of a pile of bodies to score the decisive try .

Cologne sex attacks : Women describe ` terrible ' assaults
The raids on flats and offices took place on Thursday in Berlin , Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia .
The two men and one woman detained are among four suspected of links to the so-called Islamic State group .
One of those held was being sought by Algerian authorities , and they may have been planning an attack in Germany , police said .
The New Year unrest in Cologne fuelled German unease about a huge influx of asylum seekers .
Two men - a Tunisian and a Moroccan - have been charged over the Cologne offences .
But in total there were 945 complaints to Cologne police after the New Year trouble , 559 of them allegations of sexual assault .
Thirty-five suspects are being investigated .
German authorities spoke of a new type of crime , in which gangs of drunken men - described as North African - targeted women .
Cologne resident Miriam was attacked as she and a friend made her way home on New Year 's Eve .

Fire Brigades Union -LRB- FBU -RRB- members walked out at 18:00 GMT on Friday and are due back on 4 November .
Some fire brigades have warned the public could be left `` vulnerable '' and small fires may not be attended .
Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said fire and rescue authorities have `` robust '' plans in place for the weekend .
Union officials say that under the government 's proposals firefighters will have to work until they are 60 instead of 55 , pay more into their pensions and get less in retirement .
The proposals will leave firefighters at risk of dismissal as their fitness declines into their 50s , the FBU said .
FBU members went on strike in England and Wales in August over the same dispute .
Strike action due to take place in Wales has been averted after a `` significant '' change of direction by the Welsh government , the FBU said .
General secretary Matt Wrack accused the Westminster government of `` sickening hypocrisy '' .
`` The real scandal is that their own pensions are by far the most generous anywhere in the public sector , '' he said .
One firefighter and his son carved pumpkins together and tweeted a photo in support of the strike .
`` It 's an issue which affects both me and my family and I have explained the dispute to him , '' said the firefighter , who asked not to be named .
The West Yorkshire brigade said the public would be left in a `` vulnerable position '' and asked people to take extra care this weekend .
The London brigade said it may not attend rubbish or small grass fires or help anyone stuck in a lift .
Industrial action over the past 18 months has seen fire authorities spend millions hiring contractors to cover for striking FBU members .
The FBU said it expected about 36,000 firefighters to walk out .
The fire minister said : `` All fire and rescue authorities have robust and well-tested plans in place that include back-up support if needed .
`` Public safety is the primary focus and if anyone needs emergency assistance , they should dial 999 . ''
She said strike action was `` unnecessary '' after pension regulations laid in parliament on Tuesday mean nearly three quarters of firefighters will see no change in their pension age in 2015 .

Speaking at an annual meeting of central bankers , Janet Yellen was cautiously upbeat about the US economy .
She said economic growth and a stronger jobs market meant `` the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months '' .
There has been a growing expectation that US interest rates will rise this year .
Some economists are saying that the next hike could even come next month .
The central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade , but has held them steady amid concerns over persistently low inflation .
Ms Yellen , speaking at a three-day symposium in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , did not comment on when rates would rise .
But she said `` the US economy was nearing the Federal Reserve 's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability '' .
She added : `` In light of the continued solid performance of the labour market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation , I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months . ''
However , Ms Yellen emphasised that future rate increases should be `` gradual '' .
She noted that inflation is still running below the Fed 's 2 % target , but said this is being depressed mainly by temporary factors .
Subadra Rajappa , head of rates strategy at Societe Generale , in Washington , said : `` We were n't really expecting her to signal a hike at the September meeting , but she 's just kept the door open for a hike sooner rather than later .
`` I think that the Fed wants to get the market to start pricing in a hike for this year , which they were n't doing earlier , and now I 'm seeing the probability of a hike by December has gone up slightly over a coin toss . ''
John Canally , economist at Boston-based LPL Financial , added : `` It looks like she is warming a little more to a hike this year , probably not September but probably December . ''
Signs of slow improvements in the US economy came in data published on Friday .
Although the growth rate of second quarter GDP was revised down slightly , from an annual rate of 1.2 % to 1.1 % , consumer spending - which makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity - was revised up from 4.2 % to 4.4 % .
Separately , US Labor Department figures showed that claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended 20 August .
It was the third straight weekly decline in claims .
On Tuesday , Commerce Department data showed that US new homes sales jumped in July to their fastest rate in nearly nine years .
Ms Yellen 's remarks helped lift US share markets in early trading .
On the currency markets , the dollar was flat against the euro at $ 1.1286 and slightly lower against the yen at 100.28 yen .

Ghosn said : `` We have already alerted the F1 authorities and told them : ` Do n't count on us as a provider of an engine - it 's over . ' ''
Renault is in the process of trying to negotiate a takeover of the cash-strapped Lotus team .
But Ghosn said there was still a possibility the company could walk away from F1 .
`` Our future is the subject of detailed analysis and renegotiating , '' he said .

Renault has an engine supply contract with Red Bull until 2016 .
But Red Bull are doing `` necessary due diligence '' in talking to other engine suppliers , with the team expected to use Ferrari power next year after failing to come to an agreement with Mercedes .
Ghosn said Renault would `` honour our contracts '' but admitted the company was renegotiating `` so it 's too early to say what 's going to be the conclusion '' .
Ghosn said Red Bull 's treatment of Renault during the previous six years had been instrumental in the company 's decision .
The pairing won four consecutive drivers ' and constructors ' world titles from 2010-13 , but Red Bull have been heavily critical of Renault in public since the start of 2014 .
The Austrian team accuse the French manufacturer of failing to build a competitive version of the new turbo hybrid engines that F1 adopted last year .
`` Unfortunately when we were winning championships the Renault name was never mentioned .
It was the team that was winning , '' he said .
`` So we started to feel the return on this investment was very weak .
`` It was intensified by the fact that when the technology changed and we moved from the V8 engine to the present technology , some of the teams using our engine did not fare well , and the reasons for which they are not performing became the engine .
`` So you are in the game that when you perform very well you are never mentioned , and when there is a problem with the team you are the first guy to be pointed at . ''
Ghosn said it was not a question of whether the criticism was `` fair or unfair '' .
He added : `` It 's a sport .
You ca n't just say ' I lost , but my team-mate was really ... '
`` I think it 's a question of sportsmanship .
We are expecting , that when we are in a sport working with other people , we win together and we lose together . ''

The genome sequence from a thigh bone found in Siberia shows the first episode of mixing occurred between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .
The male hunter is one of the earliest modern humans discovered in Eurasia .
The study in Nature journal also supports the finding that our species emerged from Africa some 60,000 years ago , before spreading around the world .
The analysis raises the possibility that the human line first emerged millions of years earlier than current estimates .
The work of Prof Svante Paabo , from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig , Germany , is rewriting the story of humanity .
Prof Paabo and his colleagues have pioneered methods to extract DNA from ancient human remains and read its genetic code .
From this sequence , the scientist has been able to decipher an increasingly detailed story of modern humans as they spread across the globe .
`` The amazing thing is that we have a good genome of a 45,000-year-old person who was close to the ancestor of all present-day humans outside Africa , '' He told BBC News .
Prof Paabo has analysed DNA from part of a leg bone of a man that lived in Western Siberia around 45,000 years ago .
This is a key moment at the cross roads of the world , when modern humans were on the cusp of an expansion into Europe and Asia .
The key finding was that the man had large , unshuffled chunks of DNA from a now extinct species of human , Neanderthals , who evolved outside of Africa .
`` Our analysis shows that modern humans had already interbred with Neanderthals then , and we can determine when that first happened much more precisely than we could before . ''
Prof Paabo and his team published research in 2010 that showed that all non-African humans today have Neanderthal DNA .
But that genetic material has been broken into much smaller chunks over the generations .
By extrapolating the size of DNA chunks backwards , Prof Paabo and his colleagues were able to calculate when the first interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred .
His study shows that it was between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago .
According to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London , this early interbreeding might indicate when the ancestors of people living outside of Africa today made their first steps out of the continent in which our species evolved more than 150,000 years ago .
Prof Stringer was among those who believed that the first exit by modern humans from Africa that give rise to people outside of Africa today might have happened earlier , possibly 100,000 years ago .
The evidence from Prof Paabo 's research is persuading him that it was now much later .
`` There is a dispute as to when that ` Out of Africa ' event happened and this fossil helps to look at that .
It is close to the time I think that modern humans exited from Africa and gave rise to the populations in the rest of the world .
I think that exit happened 60,000 years ago , '' he told BBC News .
The new narrative seems to fit in with a recent new , more accurate dating of the arrival of modern humans into Europe by Prof Thomas Higham of Oxford University .
Research published in August showed that this happened 45,000 years ago .
Prof Paabo 's 45,000-year-old man seems to have lived at a point that was both geographically , and in time , a crossroads for humanity .
`` This does seem to mark a watershed where modern humans were pushing the boundaries further and further in their dispersal out of Africa , '' according to Prof Stringer .
Prof Paabo also compared the DNA of the man living 45,000 years ago with those living today .
He found that the man was genetically midway between Europeans and Asians - indicating he lived close to the time before our species separated into different racial groups .
Prof Paabo was also able to estimate the rate at which human DNA has changed or mutated over the millennia .
He found that it was slower than the rate suggested by fossil evidence and similar to what has been observed in families .
`` We have caught evolution red-handed ! ''
he said gleefully .
This raises the possibility that the very first species of the human line separated from apes 10 or 11 million years ago - rather than the five or six million years ago that genetic evidence had previously suggested .
But he stressed in his research paper that much more analysis was needed before re-dating the emergence of the human line .
`` We caution that -LRB- mutation -RRB- rates may have changed over time and may differ between human populations , '' he said .

Document-Full
A High Court judge in Belfast had ruled that the PSNI should not have facilitated illegal parades , and was wrong to think it did not have legal powers to stop them .
The ruling was quashed after an appeal .
The UK Supreme Court has now been asked to overturn the decision .
There were widespread loyalist protests across Northern Ireland after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the Union flag at the City Hall every day of the year in December 2012 .
The protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and City Hall , which passed the nationalist Short Strand area .
Critics accused the police of being too soft as some of the protests descended into violence .
The PSNI insisted it did not have the legal powers to stop them , and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse .
In April 2014 , a judge in the High Court in Belfast upheld a claim by a Short Strand resident , who can not be named to protect his safety , that the PSNI had failed in its legal duty to stop the parades .
The judge said the police had not understood the full scope of their powers and had facilitated illegal and sometimes violent parades , in breach of their legal duties .
That ruling was appealed by then Chief Constable Matt Baggott , and quashed by the Court of Appeal .
The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday .
A lawyer representing the unnamed resident , told five judges the PSNI had failed in its duty to enforce the law as set out in the Public Processions Northern Ireland Act -LRB- 1998 -RRB- .
She argued that the Court of Appeal had no grounds to interfere and overturn the original trial decision as `` the evidence before the court was unimpeachable '' .
The lawyer said there were `` evident flaws '' in the Court of Appeal decision and its analysis of the evidence .
Lord Neuberger , President of the Supreme Court , asked her : `` So you say that we should go back to the trial judge and , provided we concluded that there was evidence on which he could fairly reach the decision that he did , that we should reinstate his decision ? ''
She replied : `` Yes . ''
But a lawyer representing the PSNI said the Court of Appeal had made the correct decision .
He said the context of the time the protests had taken place was important .
He told the court the police had been dealing with a series of sporadic unplanned protests at more than 80 locations across Northern Ireland .
He insisted there had been `` no error of law '' and that the police fully understood that they could have stopped the parades , but took an operational decision not to so .
He said the police believed that `` robust action '' could have made the situation worse and took a deliberate decision to secure evidence of offences committed and to prosecute offenders afterwards .
The lawyer referred to research by Queen 's University , which recorded that 306 people had been convicted of flag-protest-related offences across Northern Ireland in the months after the protests .
`` Many would have considered the police approach to policing these parades was successful , and that their policy of de-escalation succeeded , '' he said .
The judges said they would announce their decision `` in due course '' .

Chibok abductions : What we know
Hosea Abana Tsambido , the chairman of the Chibok community in the capital , Abuja , told the BBC that Amina had been found after venturing into the forest to search for firewood .
`` She was sayingâ $ ¦ all the Chibok girls are still there in the Sambisa except six of them that have already died . ''
By Will Ross , BBC News
Amina was found by a local vigilante group out on a routine patrol .
These groups , which have played a vital role in the fight against Boko Haram , sprang up in 2013 in the main city of north-east Nigeria , Maiduguri .
It was a desperate measure at a terrible time when the jihadists were winning the war , seizing territory whilst reports of soldiers fleeing rather than fighting were common .
More vigilante groups then sprang up across the north-east and , with local knowledge of the terrain , they had some success stopping their homes from being taken over - even though they were armed with just rudimentary weapons .
As the Nigerian military started getting its act together at the beginning of 2015 , with help from outside , it started retaking territory and in some areas worked effectively with the vigilantes .
There is , however , great concern that as peace returns the vigilantes - who have tasted power - pose a danger themselves .
During the April 2014 attack , Boko Haram gunmen arrived in Chibok late at night , then raided the school dormitories and loaded 276 girls on to trucks .
More than 50 managed to escape within hours , mostly by jumping off the lorries and running off into roadside bushes .
A video broadcast by CNN in April this year appeared to show some of the kidnapped schoolgirls alive .
Fifteen girls in black robes were pictured .
They said they were being treated well but wanted to be with their families .
The video was allegedly shot on Christmas Day 2015 and some of the girls were identified by their parents .
The Chibok schoolgirls , many of whom are Christian , had previously not been seen since May 2014 , when Boko Haram released a video of about 130 of them gathered together reciting the Koran .
The abduction led to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign , which was supported by US First Lady Michelle Obama and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai .

The Frenchman was one of the most promising of a new generation of Formula 1 drivers .
Bianchi , who was part of the Ferrari young driver programme , lost his battle on the night of Friday , 17 July - nine months after the crash .
The accident that led to Bianchi 's death came in an unfortunate combination of circumstances in a difficult wet race at the Suzuka track .
During the lap before Bianchi 's accident , Sauber 's Adrian Sutil had crashed at the fast , uphill Dunlop corner .
A recovery vehicle headed out to pick the car up and that section of track was put under double waved yellow caution flags , meaning a hazard bad enough that drivers should be prepared to stop .
On the next lap , on worn tyres , Bianchi arrived at the corner and lost control , and the car speared off the track and collided with the recovery vehicle , which destroyed the Marussia 's roll hoop , a device that protects the driver 's head .
Bianchi suffered massive head injuries .
After an operation , he was placed in intensive care but he succumbed three quarters of a year later .
In only 34 races he had done enough with the back-of-the-grid Marussia team to suggest he had a bright future in the sport .
It is never easy for a new driver in a struggling team to prove his worth , but Bianchi had done so by producing performances that would not normally be expected of the car , and outclassing his team-mate , Englishman Max Chilton .
There were a number of impressive drives from Bianchi , but the most high profile was his taking ninth place in the Monaco Grand Prix in May last year .
In doing so , he scored Marussia 's first and only points , as the team folded at the end of 2014 .
They now race as Manor .
It was too early in Bianchi 's career to judge his ultimate potential , and whether he could have gone on to become a race winner and even world champion .
But the signs were there that he was set for a significant career at the highest level of the sport .
Ferrari signed four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel to replace the departing Fernando Alonso in 2015 , but they had earmarked Bianchi as the man who would probably drive a third car for the team , should they be required to run one if the grid dropped below 20 cars .
Ferrari 's former president Luca Di Montezemolo said : `` This boy was born with us , and we thought of him as our driver of the future ... he would have been perfect for the coming years . ''
Bianchi came from a racing family , and it is the second time they have been touched by tragedy .
His grand-uncle Lucien Bianchi competed in 19 F1 grands prix , with a best finish of third at Monaco in 1968 , and won the 1968 Le Mans 24 Hours , before being killed testing for the race the following year .
Bianchi 's career in F1 started in 2011 , when Ferrari signed him up to be their test and reserve driver , although he had had a relationship with the team for at least two years before that .
Ferrari loaned him out to fulfil the same role for Force India in 2012 , before they facilitated his move to Marussia , to whom they supplied engines , for his debut season in 2013 .
Then Ferrari decided against promoting Bianchi to partner Alonso in 2014 , preferring to sign for a second time Finn Kimi Raikkonen , who won the world title for the team in 2007 .

His death has led to a period of introspection in a sport that had never stopped trying to improve safety since the triple world champion Ayrton Senna was killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix , the last F1 race driver to lose his life .
Alonso , a two-time world champion and close to Bianchi , said : `` This is a reminder for us that this is very dangerous , for the spectators as well .
We are here because we like our job and we are ready to take the risk because we need the adrenaline somehow as well .
But we can not make mistakes . ''
His colleagues acknowledged Bianchi 's misfortune , at the same time expressing a belief that he would want them to go on , and a hope that F1 can apply whatever lessons emerge from the inquiry into his death to make the sport that will always be dangerous safer again .
As with Senna 's death , safety changes have already been put in place , aimed at ensuring such an incident can never happen again .

Hearing partially improved when nerves in the ear , which pass sounds into the brain , were rebuilt in gerbils - a UK study in the journal Nature reports .
Getting the same improvement in people would be a shift from being unable to hear traffic to hearing a conversation .
However , treating humans is still a distant prospect .
If you want to listen to the radio or have a chat with a friend your ear has to convert sound waves in the air into electrical signals which the brain will understand .
This happens deep inside the inner ear where vibrations move tiny hairs and this movement creates an electrical signal .
However , in about one in 10 people with profound hearing loss , nerve cells which should pick up the signal are damaged .
It is like dropping the baton after the first leg of a relay race .
The aim of researchers at the University of Sheffield was to replace those baton-dropping nerve cells , called spiral ganglion neurons , with new ones .
While there is excitement at the prospect of using stem cells to restore nerves in the ear this exact technique will not help the vast , vast majority of people with hearing loss .
Most hearing problems are caused by damage to the tiny delicate hairs which convert mechanical vibrations into electricity .
This research group have also converted embryonic stem cells into the early versions of the hair cells .
However , injecting them into the ear to restore hearing will be no easy task .
The hairs cells all need to be in the exact place and pointing in exactly the right direction .
Prof Dave Moore said using stem cells to repair the hairs was `` almost an impossible task '' and that the far-fetched concept of growing and transplanting a replacement ear seemed more likely .
They used stem cells from a human embryo , which are capable of becoming any other type of cell in the human body from nerve to skin , muscle to kidney .
A chemical soup was added to the stem cells that converted them into cells similar to the spiral ganglion neurons .
These were then delicately injected into the inner ears of 18 deaf gerbils .
Over 10 weeks the gerbils ' hearing improved .
On average 45 % of their hearing range was restored by the end of the study .
Dr Marcelo Rivolta said : `` It would mean going from being so deaf that you would n't be able to hear a lorry or truck in the street to the point where you would be able to hear a conversation .
`` It is not a complete cure , they will not be able to hear a whisper , but they would certainly be able to maintain a conversation in a room . ''
About a third of the gerbils responded really well to treatment with some regaining up to 90 % of their hearing , while just under a third barely responded at all .
Gerbils were used as they are able to hear a similar range of sounds to people , unlike mice which hear higher-pitched sounds .
The researchers detected the improvement in hearing by measuring brainwaves .
The gerbils were also tested for only 10 weeks .
If this became a treatment in humans then the effect would need to be shown over a much longer term .
There are also questions around the safety and ethics of stem cell treatments which would need to be addressed .
Prof Dave Moore , the director of the Medical Research Council 's Institute of Hearing Research in Nottingham , told the BBC : `` It is a big moment , it really is a major development . ''
However , he cautioned that there will still be difficulties repeating the feat in people .
`` The biggest issue is actually getting into the part of the inner ear where they 'll do some good .
It 's extremely tiny and very difficult to get to and that will be a really formidable undertaking , '' he said .
Dr Ralph Holme , head of biomedical research for the charity Action on Hearing Loss , said : `` The research is tremendously encouraging and gives us real hope that it will be possible to fix the actual cause of some types of hearing loss in the future .
`` For the millions of people for whom hearing loss is eroding their quality of life , this ca n't come soon enough . ''

Reprinting the anti-Semitic book was banned after WW2 by Bavaria 's regional government , which held the copyright .
The copyright has now expired and Munich 's Institute of Contemporary History is to publish a new edition .
New versions are expected in many countries .
Historians say the book helps academics understand what happened in the Nazi era .
Its annotated version , with thousands of academic notes , will aim to show that Mein Kampf -LRB- My Struggle -RRB- is incoherent and badly written , rather than powerful or seductive .
Many Jewish groups have welcomed this particular publication , saying it is important to have access to a critical edition to help explain the Holocaust , reports the BBC 's Damien McGuinness in Berlin .
Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power .
After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945 , the Allied forces handed the copyright to the book to the state of Bavaria .
The local authorities have refused to allow the book to be reprinted to prevent incitement of hatred , although the book was so widely printed during the war that it remained relatively easily available .
Under European copyright law , the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work runs for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death - in Hitler 's case on 30 April 1945 , when he shot himself in his bunker in Berlin .
Those rights cease on the first day of January 70 years after the author 's death , and so publishers now have free access to the original text .
However , German officials have said they will limit public access to the text amid fears that this could stir neo-Nazi sentiment .

The Richmond Park and North Kingston MP said he was `` honoured '' after winning 70 % of the 9,227 votes cast using an online primary system .
He beat London Assembly Member Andrew Boff , MEP Syed Kamall and London 's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh .
Mr Goldsmith 's main rival is likely to be Labour 's Sadiq Khan .
Mr Khan beat former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell and a number of other current MPs to win the Labour nomination last month .
Caroline Pidgeon is the Lib Dem candidate , Sian Berry will contest the election for the Greens and UKIP has chosen its culture spokesman Peter Whittle .
Former Respect MP George Galloway is also running .
Mr Goldsmith , who was the favourite for the Tory nomination , balloted his constituents earlier this year to seek permission to stand .
At the very point of his entry into the race for London mayor , Zac Goldsmith 's decision revealed two big characteristics .
Only a politician with an acute sense of accountability would have sought permission to stand through a ballot of his constituency members in Richmond and North Kingston .
Only someone with his personal wealth would have been able to afford the estimated Â # 60,000 cost of doing it .
Both characteristics could come to feature heavily in the months to come .

He won Friday 's vote comfortably , getting 6,514 votes , more than the other three candidates combined .
Syed Kamall came second with 1,477 votes ahead of Stephen Greenhalgh -LRB- 864 -RRB- and Andrew Boff -LRB- 372 -RRB- .
Mr Goldsmith - who first entered Parliament in 2010 - told the BBC 's Daily Politics that he hoped his environmental record would appeal to Green and Lib Dem voters and he also hoped to `` reach out '' to UKIP supporters frustrated with politics as usual and the UK 's relationship with the EU .
Mr Goldsmith , who has confirmed he would stand down from Parliament if he became mayor , triggering a by-election , said he wanted to build on current mayor Boris Johnson 's achievements .
But he said anyone who attempted to replicate Mr Johnson 's style of leadership would be `` deluded '' as he was a `` unique figure '' in British politics .
`` If people are in the market for a ` Boris mark two ' are going to be very disappointed , '' he said , adding that people wanted someone who `` will bend George Osborne 's ear and get a good deal for London '' .
He also told the BBC News Channel that high-polluting vehicles should be `` phased out '' of the capital 's streets and that his biggest priority would be housing .
Both Mr Khan and Mr Goldsmith oppose a new runway at Heathrow airport , a fact described by the British Chambers of Commerce as `` depressing '' .
Mr Goldsmith is also promising more transport investment to prevent London `` grinding to a halt '' and to `` protect , enhance and improve access '' to green spaces .
Current mayor Boris Johnson will step down next year after two terms in office .
He is also currently the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip , having been returned to Parliament in May .
Some Conservatives have called for an inquiry into the mayoral election process after only 9,227 people voted - compared with a 87,884 turnout for the Labour contest .
In an attempt to open up the contest to people who were n't Conservative members , anyone on the electoral roll was able register to vote for Â # 1 .
But one of the campaign teams told the BBC earlier this month the process `` looked chaotic '' .
Speaking on the BBC 's Daily Politics , Mr Galloway dismissed Mr Goldsmith as a `` Great Gatsby figure '' who could not relate to most Londoners ' lives and Mr Khan as `` a very boring man '' .
He revealed policies including compulsorily purchasing any house left vacant for more than a year and having 50 % of all homes in the capital as social housing .

He will make 19 speeches during his tour of Kenya , Uganda and the Central African Republic -LRB- CAR -RRB- and they will probably address these issues :
He is expected to focus on religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence at a time of rising political instability and extremism in much of the region .
Security is expected to be tight throughout the trip , as the faithful flock to see this popular Pope , who has previously said that Christians would be wrong to equate Islam with violence .
His first stop , Kenya , has seen some of the worst Islamist violence : Two years ago , gunmen from the Somali militant group al-Shabab massacred at least 67 people inside Nairobi 's Westgate shopping mall .
In Uganda , his second stop , al-Shabab bombed sports bars in Kampala where fans were watching the 2010 football World Cup on TV .
Many think the third stop on his trip , the CAR , is too dangerous for him to visit .
The Pope 's visit to the capital , Bangui , where many have died in violence between largely Muslim Seleka rebels and mainly Christian `` anti-balaka '' militias , is seen as his most dangerous yet - but potentially also one of his most fruitful as a peace-maker .
In short : He will probably urge Christians and Muslims to get along .
2 .
Poverty
This is a Pope who has been hailed as the champion of a church for the poor .
His emphasis on the developing world , and the example of simplicity he sets in his own life , will be welcomed in countries where corruption in public life is often seen as an issue .
His capacity to look beyond Europe and embrace the concerns of people around the world is also likely to endear him to the faithful , and to those of other faiths , as this Pope from the southern hemisphere offers a message of hope to the dispossessed , and the struggling .
In Kenya , 75 % of the wealth is owned by around 1 % of the population , so Pope Francis 's message may well prove popular among many of the remaining 99 % .
He is likely to criticise inequality and corruption and will visit Kenya 's multi-ethnic Kangemi slum - home to around 100,000 people .
In short : He will probably criticise corruption and inequality .
With international climate change talks starting in Paris on 30 November , many will be listening closely to what Pope Francis has to say when he speaks in Nairobi to the UN 's Environment Programme .
His encyclical on the environment , `` Laudato Si '' published earlier this year , raised hackles among big business in the US with its apocalyptic warning that humankind risks turning the earth into a `` vast pile of filth '' by mistreating the planet .
The Pope is unlikely to mince his words .
He will probably emphasise the need for the developed world to stop abusing the planet for profit and to the detriment of the poor , whom he sees as the victims of climate change .
In short : He will probably tell big business to think of the poor .
LGBT -LRB- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -RRB- activists , especially in Uganda , would like the Pope to encourage greater tolerance and speak out against the criminalisation of homosexuality in many African countries .
In the past , when the Pope was asked about a gay priest he said , `` Who am I to judge ? ''
However , the recent Synod on the Family in Rome did not budge on the issue of greater acceptance within the Church for gay Catholics .
Might he directly address the discrimination against gay and lesbian communities on a continent where being gay is often still a crime ?
Activists certainly hope so .
They think it could make an enormous difference to attitudes in the continent .
Attitudes like that of Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah who told the Synod that what Nazi and Communist ideology were to the 20th Century , so the twin `` beasts '' of `` Western homosexual and abortion ideologies , and Islamic fanaticism '' were for the 21st .
In short : He is unlikely to lecture Africa on LGBT rights .
The Pope once said that Catholics did not have to breed `` like rabbits '' , before the Vatican clarified his remarks to insist that he was not speaking out against large families .
However , many international aid agencies and some Western governments would like the Roman Catholic Church to give up its opposition to artificial contraception , especially its ban on the use of condoms , to help people on a continent where Aids/HIV remains a problem .
Pope Francis is likely to meet people with HIV , but unlikely to budge on contraception .
Large Catholic families are helping to ensure that Africa becomes an ever more important part of the Church .
And the Synod on the Family in October reiterated the Church 's hostility towards aid programmes that try to link development aid to the use of artificial contraception .
In short : He is unlikely to scrap the Catholic ban on contraception .
Five African countries with the most Catholics :
1 .
Democratic Republic of Congo : 31 million
2 .
Nigeria : 20 million
3 .
Tanzania : 14.2 million
4 .
Uganda : 14.1 million
5 .
Angola : 10.8 million
Christianity is projected to be sub-Saharan Africa 's largest religious group by 2050 with 1.1 bn followers from 517 million in 2010 .
The Muslim population is expected to grow at faster rate , rising from 248 million to 670 million .

`` Stalled , '' she said , before challenging anyone in the room to name a significant change that had taken place in the last two years .
So is she right ?
Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt ?
The answer depends on how narrowly you define reform .
When she speaks , Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics .
The pace of political change has certainly slowed .
In part that 's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein 's presidency .
In the Burmese context , `` easy '' means decisions that do n't upset the army .
Political prisoners were released , censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a -LRB- flawed -RRB- law passed allowing public demonstrations .
In a short period of time , one of the world 's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible .
Stories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers , and demonstrations , mostly connected to land rights , have become almost daily events .
But the early pace of those changes has n't been sustained .
There was no way it could .
So did the reformers run out of steam ?
Did Thein Sein 's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army ?
Or perhaps we 're close to the final destination - that is , with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge .
Ms Suu Kyi 's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged .
Drafted in 2008 , it entrenches the military 's control of political life , guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw -LRB- the Burmese parliament -RRB- , and a veto over any changes to the constitution .
This is what its architects proudly call a `` disciplined democracy '' .
The opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most .
They are : the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president , which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power -LRB- because of her British sons -RRB- and Article 436 , which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes .
Much of Ms Suu Kyi 's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012 , and thus legitimised , is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition .
Just as it would in mature democracies , responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees .
With each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw , they 've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results .
Altering the `` Suu Kyi clause '' has been dismissed outright -LRB- as a threat to national sovereignty -RRB- , while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament , though if the army remains opposed there 's no way it can be changed .
Ms Suu Kyi 's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders .
Looming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year .
What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president ?
Though the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled , that 's not to say there have n't been other important developments .
It 's just that they do n't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi .
Ever since independence in 1948 , Myanmar has never been truly at peace , with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state .
The last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement .
All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process , attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future .
For President Thein Sein , a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what 's likely to be his only term in office .
Unfortunately for him , with a deal within reach , the number of clashes has begun to increase once more .
Outside politics , particularly in the big cities , people 's lives are changing fast .
Thanks to new laws and regulations , Myanmar 's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world .
GDP growth is rapid , though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind .
On Myanmar 's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market .
After years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite , there 's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information .
In itself that 's a game-changer .
So is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty ?
It rather depends who you are , and what you 're drinking .

The White Garden , at Kensington Palace , was planted to mark 20 years since Princess Diana died in a car crash .
The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour .
A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said : `` The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother . ''
They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana , including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals , the National Aids Trust , Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission .
Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana 's death .
The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris , when William , now the Duke of Cambridge , was 15 and his brother was 12 .
The garden at their mother 's former home has been inspired by memories of her life , style and image , such as her white `` Elvis '' Catherine Walker dress .
The White Garden , as it is known , follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent , famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s .
Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago .
The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses , lilies , gladioli and cosmos .
It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace , the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park , and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James 's Palace .

Police reported 1,362 criminal incidents across Canada motivated by hate , a 5 % increase from the previous year .
The findings were published on Tuesday by Statistics Canada .
The annual report by the federal statistics agency was compiled using police data from across the country .
Nearly half of all incidents were linked to race or ethnicity , with black Canadians the most common target .
Just over a third of reported hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a religion .
Canada 's Jewish population remained the most targeted religious group , accounting for 13 % of all incidents , despite a decline in the overall number of reported crimes .
Shimon Koffler Fogel , with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs , called the data `` disturbing and clear '' .
He also said in the statement that the Jewish community stood with other targeted groups in condemning hatred in all its forms .
`` An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us , '' he said .
Muslims reported being more frequently targeted in 2015 , with 159 incidents reported compared with 99 in 2014 , accounting for 12 % of all incidents .
However , Statistics Canada notes many police services have reached out to ethnic communities and there have been efforts by groups like the National Council of Canadian Muslims -LRB- NCCM -RRB- to encourage reporting .
Incidents targeting Catholics also increased , jumping from 35 to 55 individual incidents .
Almost 40 % of all reported hate crimes were considered violent incidents , which could include assault and uttering threats .
Members of the LGBT community reported slightly fewer hate crimes in 2015 but were more likely to be the victims of hate-related violence .
In a news conference following the report 's release , the NCCM 's legal counsel , Khalid Elgazzar , pointed to the murder of six men in a Quebec City mosque this January as `` a painful reminder of how hate can destroy lives and deeply shake communities '' .
The NCCM was joined by other groups in calling for more funding and resources for police forces to fight hate crimes and improve reporting .
The Statistics Canada report notes that the figures do not paint a full picture of the true extent of hate crime in Canada .
They suggest that only about 35 % of hate crimes are actually reported to police .

Document-Full
Writing in PLOS ONE they say the gene fault may encourage the formation of blood clots - the ultimate cause of most heart attacks and strokes .
Scientists hope gene tests may help doctors one day to pinpoint individuals more likely to suffer these conditions .
But experts say lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise have the greatest influence on risk .
Around one in 10 people in the Caucasian population carries this variation of the gene , named PIA2 .
And researchers from King 's College London reviewed more than 80 studies involving about 50,000 people - the largest analysis of this genetic fault to date .
They found individuals with PIA2 were more likely to have a stroke - caused by a blood clot blocking blood supply to the brain - than those without the gene .
Scientists calculate the gene increases a person 's risk of having a stroke by 10-15 % .
But how significant this increase is depends on an individual 's baseline risk - influenced by factors such as smoking , diet , weight and exercise , the scientists say .
And for people with two copies of the gene the risk rises by up to 70 % from this baseline .
In a second study published in the same journal , the scientists show PIA2 is also linked to an increased risk of heart attacks in people under 45 .
More research is needed to see whether this holds true for the whole population , they say .
About 150,000 people have a stroke in the UK each year and more than 100,000 heart attacks are recorded annually .
Both thrombotic strokes -LRB- the most common kind -RRB- and heart attacks are caused by blockage of blood vessels in the heart and brain - ultimately through the formation of clots .
The faulty gene appears to affect a protein called glycoprotein IIIa - present on platelets , natural clotting cells in the blood .
Platelets help trigger the formation of clots to stop bleeding after injury .
But scientists say carrying the gene may render them overactive .
They caution that overall the genes play a smaller role in risk than more established factors , such as high blood pressure and obesity .
But developing a genetic test could help predict people at highest risk , allowing doctors to suggest more potent medication or lifestyle changes , they say .
Prof Albert Ferro , of King 's College London , who led the research , told the BBC : `` We would now need to validate this test and see how useful it is in the clinical world . ''
Dr Shamim Quadir , of the Stroke Association , said : `` These latest results are an important step forward in stroke research .
`` We hope the findings from this study could lead to many more people who are most at risk of this devastating condition being identified .
`` However , if you have a family history of stroke or have any other risk factors , this does not mean the condition is inevitable .
Regular exercise , eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking can be important steps to significantly reduce your stroke risk . ''
Prof Jeremy Pearson , of the British Heart Foundation , said : `` It is as yet uncertain whether a genetic test to detect a variation in this protein would be beneficial for patients in everyday practice .
`` All patients who are at risk should be monitored to see whether or not lifestyle changes or medication have a positive impact on the more standard major risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol . ''

However , both palace and government sources say the Imperial Household Law would have to revised to allow for the abdication to take place .
A change to the Imperial Household Law , which stipulates the rules of succession , would require approval by Japan 's parliament .
Despite a categorical denial of the reports by imperial palace spokesman Shinichiro Yamamoto , the emperor 's reported wishes are being given prominent attention in the Japanese media .
Emperor Akihito has been admired for distancing the monarchy from its association with the aggressive nationalism of World War Two .
In 1989 he succeeded his father , Hirohito , who had had the status of a living god in Japan until he was stripped of that role by the victorious Americans who wrote the country 's post-war constitution .
Emperor Akihito had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation four years ago .
In 2011 , he took the highly unusual step of making a televised national address following the devastating earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima .
